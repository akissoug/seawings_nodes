# SeaWings ROS2 Node Diagrams

## ðŸ“Š Available Diagrams

I've created 5 comprehensive diagrams for understanding how nodes work:

### 1. **Power Monitor Node Diagram** (`seawings_power_monitor_diagram`)
- Shows battery monitoring and RTL decision flow
- Includes multi-mission tracking, WIG effect calculation
- Highlights grace periods and RTL triggers
- Color: Green theme (battery/power focus)

### 2. **Fault Detector Node Diagram** (`seawings_fault_detector_diagram`)
- Displays sensor health monitoring system
- Shows GPS, IMU, and other sensor checks
- Differentiates SITL vs Real craft modes
- Color: Blue theme (sensor/fault focus)

### 3. **Mission Supervisor Node Diagram** (`seawings_mission_supervisor_diagram`)
- Illustrates mission execution monitoring
- Shows waypoint tracking, stuck detection, timeout checks
- Includes geofence monitoring and retry logic
- Color: Purple theme (mission/supervision focus)

### 4. **System Overview Diagram** (`seawings_system_overview_diagram`)
- Complete system architecture view
- Shows PX4 integration with all three nodes
- Displays RTL decision priority system
- Shows data flow between components

### 5. **Unified Mission Detection Logic** (`seawings_mission_detection_diagram`)
- Shared logic used by all three nodes
- Shows 6 cases for mission start detection
- Illustrates state transitions and updates
- Helps understand consistent behavior across nodes


## ðŸ“Š Diagram Relationships

The diagrams work together to show:

1. **Individual Node Details** (Diagrams 1-3)
   - Internal logic and processing
   - Specific responsibilities
   - Unique decision criteria

2. **System Integration** (Diagram 4)
   - How nodes interact
   - Data flow between components
   - RTL priority system

3. **Shared Logic** (Diagram 5)
   - Common mission detection
   - Consistent state management
   - Unified behavior


## ðŸ“š Legend

### Shapes
- **Oval**: Start/End points
- **Rectangle**: Processing/State blocks
- **Diamond**: Decision points
- **Hexagon**: Major systems

### Colors
- **Light colors**: Container/grouping elements
- **Dark colors**: Active processing elements
- **Red tones**: Critical/emergency elements
